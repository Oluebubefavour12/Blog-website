      Your hair is your crown — and it deserves the same care you give your skin.  
      Beautiful, healthy hair doesn’t happen overnight, but with the right habits, you can restore shine, strength, and confidence to every strand.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Wash Smart, Not Hard</h2>
    <p>
      Washing too often can strip your hair of natural oils, leaving it dry and brittle.  
      Try washing two to three times per week with a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo.  
      Massage your scalp to boost circulation — it encourages healthy growth.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Deep Condition Weekly</h2>
    <p>
      Once a week, treat your hair to a deep conditioning mask or oil treatment.  
      Focus on the ends and leave it on for at least 20 minutes before rinsing.  
      This helps restore moisture and prevent split ends, especially if you use heat regularly.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Protect from Heat</h2>
    <p>
      Whether you’re blow-drying or using a straightener, always apply a heat protectant spray first.  
      Lower the heat setting and move the tool continuously to avoid frying sections of your hair.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Trim Regularly</h2>
    <p>
      Trimming every 6–8 weeks removes split ends before they travel up the hair shaft.  
      This keeps your strands healthy and prevents breakage, helping your hair look thicker and grow better.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Nourish from Within</h2>
    <p>
      Healthy hair starts from the inside.  
      Drink plenty of water, eat protein-rich foods, and include vitamins like biotin and omega-3s in your diet.  
      A balanced lifestyle shows — your hair will thank you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Stick to these habits, and you’ll start noticing smoother texture, better growth, and natural shine that lasts.  
      Remember, your hair deserves patience and consistency — treat it kindly, and it will reward you.
